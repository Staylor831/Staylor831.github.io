    <h1>Breakfast sliders</h1>
    <p>
        If you know, you know—these breakfast sliders
        from Community Goods are elite, 
        but who wants to wait hours in line? 
         Now you can make them at home, and dare I say,
         they taste just as good,if not better!  Buttery toasted Hawaiian rolls,
        fluffy scrambled eggs, crispy beef bacon, and creamy avocado, 
        all served with two insane dipping sauces—herb aioli
        and chipotle aioli—this
        is the ultimate breakfast treat.
