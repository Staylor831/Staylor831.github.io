        <b>Crown shyness</b>( also <sup>canopydisengment,<sup>[1]</sup>canopy 
    shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or inter crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>) Phenomenon
    obsevered in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each
    other,forming a conapy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup>The
    Phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species,but also occurs
    between trees of different species<sup>[6][7]</sup> exist many hypotheses
    as  to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that
    it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

     <p>
        The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.<sub>
        [6]</sub> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific
         literature since the 1920s.
        <sub>[9]</sub> The variety of hypotheses and experimental 
        results might suggest that
         there are multiple mechanisms across different species,
         an example of convergent evolution.<su>[citation needed]</sub>
